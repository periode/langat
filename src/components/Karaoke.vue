Iâ€™ve memorized all the fish in the sea
Iâ€™ve memorized each opportunity strangled
and
I remember awakening one morning
and finding everything smeared with the color of
forgotten love
and Iâ€™ve memorized
that too.



Iâ€™ve memorized green rooms in
St. Louis and New Orleans
where I wept because I knew that by myself I
could not overcome
the terror of them and it.



Iâ€™ve memorized all the unfaithful years
(and the faithful ones too)
Iâ€™ve memorized each cigarette that Iâ€™ve rolled.
Iâ€™ve memorized Beethoven and New York City
Iâ€™ve memorized
riding up escalators, Iâ€™ve memorized
Chicago and cottage cheese, and the mouths of
some of the ladies and the legs of
some of the ladies
Iâ€™ve known
and the way the rain came down hard.
Iâ€™ve memorized the face of my father in his coffin,
Iâ€™ve memorized all the cars I have driven
and each of their sad deaths,
Iâ€™ve memorized each jail cell,
the face of each new president
and the faces of some of the assassins;
Iâ€™ve even memorized the arguments Iâ€™ve had with
some of the women
Iâ€™ve loved.



best of all
Iâ€™ve memorized tonight and now and the way the
light falls across my fingers,
specks and smears on the wall,
shades down behind orange curtains;
I light a rolled cigarette and then laugh a little,
yes, Iâ€™ve memorized it all.



the courage of my memory.
